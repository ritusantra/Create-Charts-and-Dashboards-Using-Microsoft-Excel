# Create-Charts-and-Dashboards-Using-Microsoft-Excel

As a part of the guided project from Cousera, the aim of this project was to create charts for analysis of sales data. 
Pivot tables were created based on a number of parameters and charts were build to visualize the same. 
The charts are combined together to build dashboard.
