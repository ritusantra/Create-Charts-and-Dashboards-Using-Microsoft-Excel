# Create-Charts-and-Dashboards-Using-Microsoft-Excel

As a part of the guided project from Coursera, the aim of this project was to create charts for analysis of sales data. 
Pivot tables were created based on a number of parameters and charts were build to visualize the same. 
The charts were combined together to build dashboard.

Based on the dataset, pivot tables and charts were created to analyse the following:
* Sales by Month
* Sales by Salesperson
* Items sold by Category
* Sales profit by City
* Sales by Product Type
